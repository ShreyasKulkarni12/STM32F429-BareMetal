Hardware connections for running UART : 

Material Required : 1. Any STM32 board
	            2. FTDI-FT232 IC [USB to serial]
	            3. Tera-Term/Real-Term Application

Working : 
1. Locate the Tx, Rx and GND pins of FTDI-FT232 IC 
2. FT232's Rx should be connected to STM32's Tx and FT232's Tx should be connected to STM32's Rx and FT232's GND should be connected to GND of STM32. 
   This is very important to ensure every pin is connected correctly or it might short.
3. Connect both the STM32 and FTDI-FT232 through 2 different USB's and 2 different ports of your laptop/device.
4. Write a code to echo any message through the FTDI-FT232.
5. Flash the code to the STM32 while keeping the connections.
6. Open Real-Term and select "Port" and ensure the correct port and align the baudrate with the software, if any changes click "change",
   now go to "Send" tab, type any character or no. in the block and select "send ascii", the sent message should be echoed back on
   the Real-Term terminal.
