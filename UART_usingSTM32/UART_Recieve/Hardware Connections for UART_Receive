Hardware connections for running UART : 

Material Required : 1. Any STM32 board
	            2. FTDI-FT232 IC [USB to serial]
	            3. Tera-Term/Real-Term Application

Working : 
1. Locate the Tx, Rx and GND pins of FTDI-FT232 IC 
2. FT232's Rx should be connected to STM32's Tx and FT232's Tx should be connected to STM32's Rx and FT232's GND should be connected to GND of STM32. 
   This is very important to ensure every pin is connected correctly or it might short.
3. Connect both the STM32 and FTDI-FT232 through 2 different USB's and 2 different ports of your laptop/device.
4. Write to code to receive any message TO the STM32 through FTDI FT232.
5. Upload the code to the STM32 while keeping the connections.
6. Open Real-Term and select Port tab, now set the baud rate in it, the same one set by the software by code. now, click on "Change",
   now go to "send" and send any ascii or integer, the PG13 LED should glow on the board.
