In this program 2 DMAs and 2 different DMA Streams are used.
"DMA2_Stream0" is used to transfer data from the ADC to DMA [Periph to memory] and, the second DMA1_Stream6 is used to transfer data
from the same memory where the ADC values have been stored to the USART2 to transmit the data. the transmitted data can be viewed in 
the Real-Term Application.
