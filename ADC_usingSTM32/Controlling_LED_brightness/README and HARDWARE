Measuring the internal temprature of the SMT32F429ZITX IC with the help of an Internal Temprature sensor, connected to the ADC1_IN18 channel of the ADC peripheral.
Material Required : 1. STM32F429-Discovery board
                    2. Potentiometer
Working : 
1. Locate the OUT, VCC and GND pins of the external potentiometer 
2. OUT pin should be connected to the ADC channel (configured by software) VCC should be connected to ON-board 3.3V pin and GND should be
   connected to the ON-board GND pin.
3. Configure the timer to PWM mode by software and the CCR1 register's should be variable wrt to the ADC value to control the LED
   connected to the Timer channel pin(configured by software)
4. By software, write a code to turn on the ADC, and start the "continous" conversion. 
5. Slide the potentiometer to control the brightness of the LED.
6. You can also configure the UART module to display the real-time ADC values while sliding the potentiometer.
