Using ADC of the SMT32F429ZITX IC to control USART6 peripheral.
Material Required : 1. STM32F429-Discovery board
                    2. Potentiometer
Working : 
1. Locate the OUT, VCC and GND pins of the external potentiometer 
2. OUT pin should be connected to the ADC channel (configured by software) VCC should be connected to ON-board 3.3V pin and GND should be
   connected to the ON-board GND pin.
3. Configure the USART6 by software for TX.
4. By software, write a code to turn on the ADC, and start the "continous" conversion. 
5. Slide the potentiometer to control the USART6 Transmission.
