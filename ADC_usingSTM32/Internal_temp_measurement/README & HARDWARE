Measuring the internal temprature of the SMT32F429ZITX IC with the help of an Internal Temprature sensor, connected to the ADC1_IN18 channel of the ADC peripheral.
Material Required : 1. STM32F429-Discovery board
                    2. FTDI-FT232 module for UART
                    3. Real-Term application
Working : 
1. Locate the Tx, Rx and GND pins of FTDI-FT232 IC 
2. FT232's Rx should be connected to STM32's Tx and FT232's Tx should be connected to STM32's Rx and FT232's GND should be connected to GND of STM32. 
   This is very important to ensure every pin is connected correctly or it might short.
3. Connect both the STM32 and FTDI-FT232 through 2 different USB's and 2 different ports of your laptop/device.
4. By software, write a code to turn on the VREFINT bit, ADC, and start the "continous" conversion. 
5. The VREFINT bit internally is connected to the ADC1_IN18 channel and after flashing the code, turn on the Real-Term application
6. The temprature values should be displayed, remember that ADCx->DR register is 16-bit and UARTx->DR is only 8 bit, so for a 12-bit ADC
   the data should be sent twice by shifting the bits and sending again. In the Output image, there is "4" value which indicates
   the data in the last 4 bits towards the MSB.
